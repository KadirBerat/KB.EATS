- Due to the deadline, the AI side could not be done.
- Similarly, the mobile project could not be started either.
- There are deficiencies in the web interface and general analysis codes.
- There are also a few errors I noticed on the data analysis side.
- Due to the deadline, I delivered the project this way and the development process is currently stopped.
- Compared to other projects in my department, my project is sufficient for my graduation.
- In the future, if I have free time, I plan to make this project functional, starting from the beginning.
- As far as I understand, the main reason for the errors that occur and the slowdown in the project's operation is the logic error in my algorithm.
